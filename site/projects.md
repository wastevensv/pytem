# Projects
I build projects mostly for fun, learning something or making something useful is always a great byproduct. Below are some links to some of my projects. I hope they can be useful to someone.

## [AIML Designer](https://github.com/wastevensv/AIML-Designer)
This program was made partially as a byproduct of the tedious work of writing the same XML tags over and over again while I was making a [Chatbot](https://github.com/wastevensv/Chatbot). It was also made as a way for me to practice using User Controls in Visual Basic for a programming competition I was preparing for.
